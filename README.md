## Planned Changes

The following are the current plans for changes to MOSAIC's Power Board. 

- The current version of MOSAIC's Power Board is designed to be used with only a single-cell LiPo battery like [this one](https://www.sparkfun.com/lithium-ion-battery-2ah.html). Future iterations of the Power Board should include the option to utilize different energy storage methods, such as AA and 18650 batteries. This, of course, will require a different charger circuit for each method, so the board may include a new slot where users can plug in their preferred power charger circuit.
